# CNN
In neural networks, Convolutional neural network (ConvNets or CNNs) is one of the main categories to do images recognition, images classifications.Deep learning CNN models to train and test, each input image will pass it through a series of convolution layers with filters (Kernals), Pooling, fully connected layers (FC) and apply Softmax function to classify an object with probabilistic values between 0 and 1
